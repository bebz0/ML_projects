# ML_projects

A **personal collection of machine learning experiments, ideas, and practice projects** — created by me as a student learning ML in Python.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is *not* a professional-grade machine learning codebase. Instead, it’s a collection of small tasks, experiments, and notebooks where I tried to bring ideas to life while learning and exploring different ML techniques.

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository is a **work-in-progress sandbox** for machine learning practice:  
- It contains explorations, simple implementations, and experiments with common ML methods.
- Projects are created for learning and experimentation, not for production use.
- Each sub-project or file is a snapshot of something I wanted to try or understand better.

This repo shows the *journey of learning* rather than polished, engineered code.

## 🗂️ What's Inside

The repository currently includes:

├── Calibration # Example of calibration task

├── Linear regression task # Linear regression experiment

├── KNN.ipynb # self-made k-nearest neighbors classification 

├── LICENSE


Most of the code is in **Jupyter notebooks**, which are great for exploration and documenting thoughts while learning.

## 🧪 What You Can Find Here

Typical contents include:
- Supervised learning experiments (e.g., regression, classification)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) in notebooks
- Model training and evaluation snippets
- Notes and scratch work while learning ML concepts

The structure is informal and often changes as I experiment with new ideas.

## 🛠 How to Use

To explore these notebooks and scripts:

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bebz0/ML_projects.git
   cd ML_projects

2) Open with Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab

3) Explore the folders / notebooks and run experiments.

## 📌 Important Note

This repository is intended for learning and experimentation only — not for production, deployment, or high-quality ML engineering standards.

The code and methods may not follow best practices, but reflect my process of understanding machine learning concepts step by step.
